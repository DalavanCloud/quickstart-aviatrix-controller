# quickstart-aviatrix-controller


This readme covers two Amazon Web Services (AWS) Quick Starts that help you build a highly available Aviatrix Controller in a virtual private cloud (VPC) on the AWS Cloud. 

There are two options for deploying the Aviatrix Controller, along with a corresponding AWS Quick Start:

- [Deploying Aviatrix Next-Gen Global Transit Hub on AWS](Transit-Hub-README.md)
- [Deploying Aviatrix User VPN on AWS](User-VPN-README.md)

To post feedback, submit feature ideas, or report bugs, use the **Issues** section of this GitHub repo.
If you'd like to submit code for this Quick Start, please review the [AWS Quick Start Contributor's Kit](https://aws-quickstart.github.io/).
